# A weekly social data project in R

TidyTuesday is a weekly data project aimed at the R ecosystem. This project was borne out of the R4DS Online Learning Community and the R for Data Science textbook, and there is an emphasis on understanding how to summarize and arrange data to make meaningful charts with ggplot2, tidyr, dplyr, and other tools in the tidyverse ecosystem.
